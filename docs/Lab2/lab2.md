# Lab 2
## Monday 09/16/2019

In this lab we implemented a Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) to identify a specific tone that is to eventually be generated as a start tone at competition. This was done by using the Arduino FFT Library, polling an analog audio sensor, along with multiple filters, both digital and analog.

***1. Getting the microphone working***

To get the microphone working, we first started with the stock schematic that was provided to us on the lab 2 website. This schematic is shown below. With the microphone hooked up to the analog pin, we were able to then use the FFT library from Arduino to get the Fast-Fourier Transform of the audio.
