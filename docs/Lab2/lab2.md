# Lab 2
## Monday 09/16/2019

In this lab we implemented a Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) to identify a specific tone that is to eventually be generated as a start tone at competition. This was done by using the Arduino FFT Library, polling an analog audio sensor, along with multiple filters, both digital and analog.

***1. Getting the microphone working ***
***2. Getting started with the FFT ***
***3. Filtering the incoming signal***
***4. Detecting the correct tone***
