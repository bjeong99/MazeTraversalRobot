# Objectives

   The objective of this milestone is to make the robot successfully traverse a line and complete a figure eight pattern.
   
   **Materials:**
   - 1 Arduino Uno
   - 1 USB A/B cable
   - 2 Parallax Servos
   - 3 line sensors
   - 1 solderless breadboard
   - Team-made chassis
   
# Process #

1. Our initial design had to be changed. Before we started the milstone, we had two S-shaped pillars that would hold the left and right line sensors in place and the third one was attached to the pillar that housed the ball bearing. However, this was a problem because the heights of the sensors were not uniform; we discovered that the different heights would affect the output values of whether the sensors were detecting dark colors and light colors.
