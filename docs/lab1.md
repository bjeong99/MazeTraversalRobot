In this lab we got familiar with the arduino. Below is a list of the things that we demo'ed with the arduino board along with addition periferals such as a potentiometer and servo motor.

1.Blinking an LED

2.Polling and displaying analog data

3.Analog(PWM) output

4.Servo Motor Control

As well as the above list of demos that we did with the arduino, we also made the first steps in constructing our robot.
