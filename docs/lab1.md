# Lab 1
## Monday 09/09/2019

In this lab we got familiar with the arduino. Below is a list of the things that we demo'ed with the arduino board along with addition periferals such as a potentiometer and servo motor.

1.Blinking an LED
  - We modified the blink sketch provided by the Arduino program to work for an external LED rather than the LED on the Arduino board. We tested this modified code on all the digital pins.

2.Polling and displaying analog data
  - Next, we used a potentiometer to input different voltages and printed these values on the screen. We wrote a loop function that would output the circuit's analog value every half-second.

3.Analog(PWM) output
  - Once we understood how to use analog, we used PWM to create a 'analog output'. We used an LED attached to a digial pin to set it up as an output pin, and used the analog value from the potentiometer to change the brightness of the LED.

4.Servo Motor Control

As well as the above list of demos that we did with the arduino, we also made the first steps in constructing our robot.
